                <p> When my mother died I was very young, </p> 
                <p>And my father sold me while yet my tongue </p> 
                <p>Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!" </p> 
                <p>So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep. </p> 
                <br>
                <p>There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head </p> 
                <p>That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said, </p> 
                <p>"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare, </p> 
                <p>You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair." </p> 
                <br>
                <p> And so he was quiet, & that very night, </p> 
                <p> As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight! </p> 
                <p> That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, </p> 
                <p> Were all of them locked up in coffins of black; </p> 
                <br>
                <p> And by came an Angel who had a bright key, </p> 
                <p> And he opened the coffins & set them all free; </p> 
                <p> Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run, </p> 
                <p> And wash in a river and shine in the Sun. </p> 
                <br>
                <p> Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, </p> 
                <p> They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind. </p> 
                <p> And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, </p> 
                <p> He'd have God for his father & never want joy. </p> 
                <br>
                <p> And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark </p> 
                <p> And got with our bags & our brushes to work. </p> 
                <p> Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm; </p> 
                <p> So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm. </p>
