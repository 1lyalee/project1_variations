                    <br> When my mother died I was very young,
                    <br> And my father sold me while yet my tongue
                    <br> Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"
                    <br> So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.
                    <br>
                    <br> There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head
                    <br> That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said,
                    <br> "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare,
                    <br> You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."

                    <br> And so he was quiet, & that very night,
                    <br> As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight!
                    <br> That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack,
                    <br> Were all of them locked up in coffins of black;
                    <br>
                    <br> And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
                    <br> And he opened the coffins & set them all free;
                    <br> Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run,
                    <br> And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.
                    <br>
                    <br> Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,
                    <br> They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.
                    <br> And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
                    <br> He'd have God for his father & never want joy.
                    <br>
                    <br> And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark
                    <br> And got with our bags & our brushes to work.
                    <br> Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm;
                    <br> So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.
