                    THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER <br>
                    BY WILLIAM BLAKE
            </h2>
        </div>
        
        <div class="center">
            <p id="text">  When my mother died I was very young, </p>
            <p id="text">  And my father sold me while yet my tongue </p>
            <p id="text">  Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!" </p>
            <p id="text">  So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep. </p>
        
            <p id="text">  There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head  </p>
            <p id="text">  That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said, </p>
            <p id="text">  "Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare, </p>
            <p id="text">  You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair." </p>

            <p id="text">  And so he was quiet, & that very night, </p>
            <p id="text">  As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight! </p>
            <p id="text">  That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, </p>
            <p id="text">  Were all of them locked up in coffins of black; </p>

            <p id="text">  And by came an Angel who had a bright key, </p>
            <p id="text">  And he opened the coffins & set them all free; </p>
            <p id="text">  Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run, </p>
            <p id="text">  And wash in a river and shine in the Sun. </p>
            <p id="text"> 
            <p id="text">  Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, </p>
            <p id="text">  They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind. </p>
            <p id="text">  And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, </p>
            <p id="text">  He'd have God for his father & never want joy. </p>

            <p id="text">  And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark </p>
            <p id="text">  And got with our bags & our brushes to work. </p>
            <p id="text">  Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm; </p>
            <p id="text">  So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm. </p>
