        <p>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;When my mother died I was very young,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And my father sold me while yet my tongue
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Could scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."

            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And so he was quiet, & that very night,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight!
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Were all of them locked up in coffins of black;
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And by came an Angel who had a bright key,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And he opened the coffins & set them all free;
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He'd have God for his father & never want joy.
            <br>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And got with our bags & our brushes to work.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm;
            <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.
